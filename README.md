# p5-base-project

`p5-base-project` aims to be the minimal remixable project to get you up and running with p5.js.

## What's included?

You get a simple, almost-empty (except for the Glitch button) full-page p5 canvas thanks to
`index.html` and `style.css`.

`sketch.js` is where you put your p5.js code. As a demo, all it does is draw a circle in the
middle of the screen. The p5 world is your oyster!

## How do I start?

Make changes to `sketch.js`. There are stubs for `setup()` and `draw()`
there ready for you.

If you want more [p5 libraries](https://p5js.org/libraries/), go ahead and add
a line for them in `index.html`.
